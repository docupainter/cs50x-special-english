# cs50x-special-english
An independent English-learning series originally designed for the **CS50x Iran community**, this project supports **CS50x-inspired learners**—those who are exploring computer science through the CS50x course or similar paths, especially non-native English speakers.

The materials are tailored to build confidence in **technical, academic, and business English**, using accessible language and CS-related themes. Each weekly PDF blends key communication skills with topics aligned with the spirit of CS50x, making it suitable for self-learners, educators, and international students in tech.

  
# 📘 CS50x Special English – Independent Language Series for Learners

This repository contains a custom English-learning series created for learners interested in both **computer science** and **language development**, especially those engaging with [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard's *Introduction to Computer Science*.

The materials are independent of CS50x, but inspired by its weekly structure, topics, and spirit of accessibility.


## 📝 Notes on File Naming and Versions

- **R&V** stands for **Reading and Vocabulary**.  
  Files like `week0 R&V_tech jobs.pdf` are focused on developing reading skills and vocabulary around a CS-related theme.

- The folder `optional-persian-guides/` contains the same English material, but with an **additional Persian-language study guide** for learners who benefit from bilingual support.  
  > 🗒️ Only the study guide is in Persian — the main lessons and content remain fully in English.
  

## 📂 What’s Included

This series includes **8 weekly PDF files** (Week 0 to Week 7) designed to:

- Build **English communication skills** around tech-related content  
- Introduce key **CS concepts and vocabulary** in accessible English  
- Reinforce **grammar, reading, and expression** through practical tasks
